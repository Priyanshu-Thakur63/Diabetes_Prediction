# Diabetes_Prediction

ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A simple yet effective machine learning project that uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic health measurements. The model is built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which is ideal for small to medium-sized classification tasks.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Goal: Predict the presence of diabetes using 8 health-related features.

Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (via Kaggle).

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

Metric: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
